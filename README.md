This is my private repository for Master Degree in Computer Technology @ University of Computer Studies, Mandalay (UCSM).
My research concentrates on hybrid NIPS on Software-Defined Networking architecture, and used both signature-based and anomaly-based methods to protect the entire network.
Ryu is used as the centralized SDN controller.
Mininet is used for the emulated SDN Network.
Snort is used as signature-based NIPS on SDN for packet-based detection and Artificial Neural Network in used for anomaly-based detection of the flow table entries.
